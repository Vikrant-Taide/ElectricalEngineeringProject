 Fault Analysis On Three Phase System By Auto Reclosing Mechanism. 

 As we know that nowadays electricity is the need of all the human beings, continuity of power flow without getting interrupted is the prime demand in current scenario. 
 But due to the natural phenomenon, the power system may face problem of excess current production in transmission lines and this situation can be defined as the fault in power system. 
 This fault can severely damage the electrical equipment connected in power system and as an electrical engineer, the rectification of this problem is needed. 
 In this project, efforts are made to design the reclosing mechanism for temporary and permanent fault. 
 A set of switches are used to create the L-L and L-G faults in low voltage side, for the activation of tripping mechanism. 
 To overcome this problem, a system is built which can sense these faults and automatically disconnects the supply to avoid severe damage of equipments. 
 Here, we used 555 timer IC with relay for temporary and permanent faults. 
 In case of faults for short duration, the mechanism returns the supply back to the load immediately and is called as temporary trip. 
 While for the purpose of faults for long duration, it will result in permanent tripping of circuit.
